= A tale of two values
This chapter talks that software engineers deliver two values to the product: behavior and structure.

Behavior is about the features, and structure is about the architecture. The one with more value is architecture, because if I have a program with good architecture I can easily add behavior, but not on the other way.

The chapter also explains that architecture is important, but not urgent. In the Eisenhower matrix the levels are.

1. Urgent and important.
2. Important but not urgent.
3. Urgent but not important.
4. Not important and not urgent.

You see important (as architecture is) is in the top 2 positions.

The chapter also makes a metaphor about puzzle pieces. Each requirement is a piece and the architecture must make them fit. The more an architecture prefers a shape, the more difficult will be to fit new requirements, that is why Architecture should not tend to any shape, should be as shape agnostic as possible.

We, as devs should fight for what we think is good for the software (in this case, the architecture).

*Key points*
- Architecture is more valuable than behavior.
- Software architecture should be shape agnostic (as possible).
- Devs should fight for the architecture.
- Architects are more focused in the structure than in features and functions.

*Key quotes / Passages*
- "Software was intended to be soft. If we'd wanted the behavior of machines to be hard to change, we would have called it hardware."
- "The more an architecture prefers one shape over another, the more likely new feature will be harder and harder to fit on that structure."

*Personal insights*
I got the lucky to work with an architect, he was the person with the cleaner code I have seen. Even if I was not aware of the logic and how the function works, I always had an idea of what the function was doing.

I like the metaphor of the puzzle pieces, and with the statement "software has to be soft, otherwise, we would call it hardware." 

It is clear to me after this chapter, that the role of an architect is more about structure more than functions.
