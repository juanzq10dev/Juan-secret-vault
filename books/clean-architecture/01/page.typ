= What is design and architecture?
This chapter explains that low-level details and high-level structure are part of the same whole, so architecture is about both.

The second part shows diagrams of a company that over the releases code became a mess, and because of that:
- Productivity went closer to zero
- Budget increased considerably (more and more developers were needed to maintain the code.)
- Devs felt frustrated due to low productivity.

Third part showed results of an experiment that demonstrated that building a project doing TDD is considerably faster than building a project without TDD.

*Key points*
- Architecture encompasses both: the fundamental structural choices and the finer implementation details that bring them to life.
- A good software design is one that is easy to maintain, implement and evolve.
- Developers (and executives) often prioritize speed over quality, promising to “clean it up later”, but later never arrives as new priorities and deadlines continuously take precedence.
- Rapidly delivered, poorly structured code is the seed of long-term disaster.

*Key quotes / Passages*:
- "The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system."
- "The only way to go fast, is to go well."

*Personal insights*:
#linebreak()I was told lots of times that architecture is about high-level structure, surprisingly it is not, and it makes sense, because those low-level details sustain the high-level decisions.

I completely agree with the part of diagrams. I know apps that were stopped because code is a mess and it is unsustainable (Finale). It reminds me to a meme I saw: It was a worker building bad a wall and the meme said: "We will refactor it later".

I feel curious about the experiment of TDD, I know many devs that do not like TDD, maybe I should try once to see if I am more productive and I think it can help LLMs to use to deliver cleaner code too.
