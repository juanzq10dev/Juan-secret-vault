= Paradigm overview
There are three paradigms:

+ *Structured programming:* removes `goto` statements.
+ *Object oriented programming:* removes function pointers.
+ *Functional programming:* removes assignments.

All were invented between the 50's and the 60's. So probably will probably there will not be more.

All this paradigms are interesting for architecture:

+ Polymorphism crosses architectural boundaries.
+ Functional programming to impose discipline on the location access to data.
+ Structured programming as the algorithmic foundation of our modules.

*Key concepts*
- There are three types of paradigms and there (probably) will not be more.
- Paradigms tells us what not to do, instead of tells us what to do.

*Key quotes/passages*
- Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control.
- Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control.
- Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment.

*Personal insights:* I did not know that there are three paradigms. I surprised that all three paradigms are important for architecture. I think it is true, sometimes while doing OOP I ensure that functions are pure, and purism is something of functional programming.
