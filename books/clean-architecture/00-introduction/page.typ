= Foreword, Preface and Introduction

*Key points*
- Architecture rules are the same for all software (because software nowadays is build of `if` and `for` loops as it was 50 years ago).
- A good architecture meets the requirements of the software over time (not a given point of time).
- In a good architecture significant changes are easy to do.

// - *Important definitions / concepts*

// - *Diagrams / Notes*

*Interesting quotes/passages*
- "Software is build from small pieces of software that are build from small pieces of software and so on.""
- "When software is done right (...), effort is minimized, and functionality and flexibility are maximized."
- "Getting something to work is easy (...). Getting it right is another matter..."

*Personal insights*: I like the introduction, pretty straight to the point, and it really makes want to know more about architecture and how to be a good architect.
