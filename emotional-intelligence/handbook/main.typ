    *Abstract* \
    These are notes on emotional intelligence that I gathered during sessions with my therapist. I have refined some of the concepts through additional research. The notes are not organized in any particular order and are intended as a collection of concepts about emotional intelligence, rather than suggestions or therapeutic techniques. I emphasize this distinction because I am not a therapist, and I do not consider it appropriate to provide such guidance.

= Pain & Suffering.
There are key differences between pain and suffering:

== Pain
- Pain it is a natural biological response.
- It may be physical or emotional.
- You cannot avoid pain :)
- Pain has adaptive function: it is a sign that something needs attention.
- Pain is related to a present situation.

Examples of pain:
- If you lose a person you appreciate you will fell pain, and you need to adapt to a new situation: you will not have that person anymore in your life (remember that pain has adaptive function)

- If you brake one leg while playing soccer you will feel pain, and you will probably need to go to the doctor (remember that pain is a sign that something needs attention).

== Suffering
- Suffering is the reaction we have to pain.
- Suffering is teh resistance to change caused by an event that causes pain.
- Suffering is on your mind.
- Luckily, you can avoid suffering (it is on your mind, believe it or not, you can control your mind).
- Suffering lasts much longer than pain (but it should not, do not let suffer trap your mind).
- Do not let suffer trap your mind.

Examples of suffering:
- If you lose a person you appreciate you *may* (I am remarking 'may' because suffering is optional) suffer with thoughts like:
  - "I should have spent more time with him/her"
  - "I really wish he/she was here"

- If you brake one leg while playing soccer, probably you will not be able to play soccer for three months more or less. You may suffer with thoughts like:
  - "Now I am not able to play football anymore"
  - "Now I cannot even walk, I am useless".

= Overthinking
*What is?*
- It is when you repeatedly analyze over the same thoughts, often negative, or "what if" scenarios.
- It makes you feel that a situation is much bigger and important than it really is.
- It traps your mind in the problem, and it does not allow you to take a final decision.
- It is horrible, you may overthink a situation too much, and you will probably get tired, because overthinking is really overwhelming.
- Overthinking is valid, but most of times is unnecessary, accept your thoughts like if they were clouds, but do not let them trap your mind.

*Why it happens?* \
Some reasons, may be:
- Fear of uncertainty:
  - You want total control of a situation.
  - You have fear of what you may happen.
- You get used to it, and it became automatic on you.

= Auto-sabotage
*What is it?*
- Sabotage are all deliberative behaviors you do to undermine your own goals or success.

*Examples:*
- Staying on your phone until late hours instead of doing your homework.
- Doing other things instead of what you have to do. Like ordering your bed, or cleaning your house, instead of doing your homework.

*Why it happens?* \
There are lots of reasons, this may be some of them:
- Fear (of failure, of judgement, of conflict, of uncertainty, etc)
- Doubting of your own skills. 
- Low self-esteem.

= Limits
- Limits are personal boundaries that define what you accept and what you do not. 

- There are three ways to put limits to other persons:
 - *Spoken:* You clearly express what behavior bothered you and you explain why it did. This explanation is important, it helps the other person to understand your perspective.

   Example: 
   "I know it is a joke to you, but I do not like you doing that, it makes me uncomfortable me"

 - *Limitings:* If you have already spoken, but the person does not seem to listen or to respect your boundary, you begin to distance yourself from him/she.
 - *Definitive:* If even after several chances, the behavior continues, you end contact.
