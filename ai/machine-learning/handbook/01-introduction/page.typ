= Introduction

== Machine learning
- *What is it?*
  A Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

- *How does it work?*
  - Learns patterns from data using algorithms.
  - Involves training a model on labeled or unlabeled data.

- *Use cases*
  - Recommendation systems.
  - Voice assistants.
  - Spam detection.

== Supervised learning
- *What is it?*
  A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data

- *How does it work?*
  - Input data (X) and known outputs (Y) are used to train.
  - The model learns to map inputs to outputs.

- *Use cases*
  - Span detection.
  - Disease prediction.
  - Stock price forecasting.

== Supervised learning
- *What is it?*
  A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data

- *How does it work?*
  - Input data (X) and known outputs (Y) are used to train.
  - The model learns to map inputs to outputs. (tries to predict)

- *Use cases*
  - Spam detection.
  - Disease prediction.
  - Stock price forecasting.

== Unsupervised learning
- *What is it?*
  A type of machine learning where the model finds patterns or structure in data *without labeled* outputs.

- *How does it work?*
  - Only input data (X) is providedâ€”no known outcomes.
  - The model tries to group, compress, or organize data.

- *Use cases*
  - Exploring data
  - Market segmentation.
  - Dataset organization.
